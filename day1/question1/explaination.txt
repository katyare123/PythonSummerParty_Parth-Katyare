🧠 Objective:
Find the average number of participants in WhatsApp groups that were created in October 2024 using pandas.

🔍 Here's the code again, explained step-by-step:

import pandas as pd
✅ What it does:

This line imports the pandas library, which is essential for handling tabular data like spreadsheets or SQL tables in Python.

We’ll use pd as an alias to access pandas functions.


# Let's assume dim_groups is already defined or loaded in your environment
# Example: dim_groups = pd.read_csv("dim_groups.csv")
✅ What it means:

This is a comment. It assumes you already have the data (a table) loaded in a variable called dim_groups.

If you had a CSV file of the data, you'd load it like:


dim_groups = pd.read_csv("dim_groups.csv")

dim_groups['created_date'] = pd.to_datetime(dim_groups['created_date'])
✅ What it does:

Converts the created_date column in your table to datetime format.

This is important because initially, the date might just be stored as text (a string).

Once it's in datetime format, you can extract .year, .month, etc. easily.


october_2024_groups = dim_groups[
    (dim_groups['created_date'].dt.year == 2024) &
    (dim_groups['created_date'].dt.month == 10)
]
✅ What it does:

This filters the DataFrame to only include rows (i.e., WhatsApp groups) that were created in October 2024.

dim_groups['created_date'].dt.year == 2024 ensures the year is 2024.

dim_groups['created_date'].dt.month == 10 ensures the month is October.

The & means "AND" — both conditions must be true.

The result is stored in a new DataFrame: october_2024_groups.


average_participants = october_2024_groups['participant_count'].mean()
✅ What it does:

Takes the filtered DataFrame (october_2024_groups) and selects only the participant_count column.

Then it uses .mean() to compute the average number of participants in those groups.


print("Average number of participants in groups created in October 2024:", average_participants)
✅ What it does:

Displays the final result in the terminal/output.

It prints a message followed by the calculated average.

✅ Example Output:
If the average was 65.4, you'd get:

Average number of participants in groups created in October 2024: 65.4
