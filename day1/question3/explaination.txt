🔍 Goal of This Code:
You want to analyze large WhatsApp groups (with more than 50 participants) that were created in October 2024, and find out the average number of messages they sent.
This tells your product team how active larger groups are and whether new group features might be useful.

🐍 Full Code Explanation:

import pandas as pd
✅ What it does:

Imports the pandas library, which is used for data manipulation and analysis in Python.

We'll use pd to call pandas functions.


# Convert created_date to datetime
dim_groups['created_date'] = pd.to_datetime(dim_groups['created_date'])
✅ Why this is important:

The created_date column likely stores dates as text/strings.

Converting it to datetime format allows us to easily filter by year and month, like .dt.year == 2024.

📌 After this line:


'2024-10-15' (string) → 2024-10-15 00:00:00 (datetime object)

# Filter groups: created in October 2024 AND participant_count > 50
filtered_groups = dim_groups[
    (dim_groups['created_date'].dt.year == 2024) &
    (dim_groups['created_date'].dt.month == 10) &
    (dim_groups['participant_count'] > 50)
]
✅ What's happening here:

We're filtering the data to only include specific groups that match all 3 conditions:

created_date is in 2024

Month is October (i.e., .dt.month == 10)

participant_count > 50 (i.e., large groups)

📦 Example: Suppose dim_groups has 1000 rows (groups).
This line might return only 47 rows — groups matching your conditions.
# Calculate average number of messages
average_messages = filtered_groups['total_messages'].mean()
✅ What it does:

From the filtered set of large October 2024 groups, it selects only the total_messages column.

Then it calculates the average using .mean().

📌 If the groups had these message counts:
[220, 300, 150, 400] → The average would be (220+300+150+400)/4 = 267.5
print("Average messages sent in large groups (Oct 2024):", average_messages)
✅ What it does:

Prints the result to the screen.

So you or your team can see the insight in plain English.

🖨️ Example Output:
Average messages sent in large groups (Oct 2024): 267.5
🧠 Why This Analysis Matters
If the average is high, it means larger groups are very active.

If the average is low, it suggests even big groups may not engage much.
