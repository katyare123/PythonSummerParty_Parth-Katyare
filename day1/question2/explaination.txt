🎯 Objective:
You want to calculate the average number of participants in WhatsApp groups that were created in October 2024.

This helps your team understand the typical size of new groups being formed that month, which is useful for product planning and server optimization.

🔍 The Data
You’re working with a table called dim_groups that looks like this:

group_id	created_date	participant_count	total_messages
G1	2024-10-05	120	5400
G2	2024-09-15	45	300
G3	2024-10-10	80	5000

✅ Full Code With Detailed Explanation:

import pandas as pd
This line imports the pandas library, which is the most popular Python tool for working with tabular data.

We use the alias pd to call pandas functions (like pd.read_csv() or pd.to_datetime()).


# Let's assume dim_groups is already defined or loaded in your environment
# Example: dim_groups = pd.read_csv("dim_groups.csv")
This is just a comment (not executed).

It tells you that the dim_groups DataFrame is already available.

If not, you’d typically load it from a file using pd.read_csv() or a database query.


dim_groups['created_date'] = pd.to_datetime(dim_groups['created_date'])
This line converts the 'created_date' column to datetime format.

This step is crucial because if the dates are stored as text, you can’t filter by month or year.

After conversion, you can use .dt.year and .dt.month.

✅ Example:


'2024-10-05' → becomes → Timestamp('2024-10-05 00:00:00')

october_2024_groups = dim_groups[
    (dim_groups['created_date'].dt.year == 2024) &
    (dim_groups['created_date'].dt.month == 10)
]
This is where the real filtering happens:

🧠 What it does:

Filters only the rows where:

Year is 2024

Month is October (month 10)

The & operator combines both conditions (AND).

The result is stored in a new DataFrame: october_2024_groups.

📦 If dim_groups had 1,000 rows, this might return only 130 rows — all from October 2024.


average_participants = october_2024_groups['participant_count'].mean()
📊 This line:

Picks just the participant_count column from the filtered data.

Uses .mean() to calculate the average (arithmetic mean).

✅ Example:


[100, 80, 60, 120] → mean = (100 + 80 + 60 + 120) / 4 = 90
The result is stored in a new variable average_participants.


print("Average number of participants in groups created in October 2024:", average_participants)
🖨️ Output:

Prints the result clearly, with a message.

✅ Example:


Average number of participants in groups created in October 2024: 87.6
📌 Summary of Logic:
Step	What it does
1	Convert created_date to proper datetime format
2	Filter for groups made in Oct 2024
3	Find average number of participants in those groups
4	Print the result

🧠 Why This Matters (Real Analysis Use)
If the average group size is high, WhatsApp might need to optimize for large-group performance (e.g., better moderation tools).

If it’s low, they may focus on features useful for smaller, private groups.
